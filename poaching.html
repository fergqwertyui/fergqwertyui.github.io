    <h1>Algorithm used for deterring poachers</h1>
    <p1>
        Drones fly over parks in South Africa, they use infrared camera's and an AI detection system to detect poachers, notifying nearby rangers and more importantly, flashing lights to scare off the poachers, if poachers are present. However as parks in South Africa are very big and poachers are spread very thin, there might not be a ranger present to stop the poachers so the alarm might not deter poachers as they start to get wise to what's really going on. On top of this, chances of false negatives also mean that sometimes the alarm isn't raised when it should be, giving the poacher insurance that they are safe, which is the opposite of what needs to be achieved. To combat this a <a href = "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/To-Signal-or-Not-To-Signal%3A-Exploiting-Uncertain-in-Bondi-Kelly-Oh/6c13529720f1a3fc3969b7f1531c1ce6e8d9d22d?p2df"> paper </a> was written by computer scientists to take advantage of real life uncertainties to scare off the poachers. The simplified idea is that when A drone sees a poacher and a ranger nearby, it will signal the alarm as the ranger is likely to stop the poacher, but if there is no ranger nearby, it may or may not signal, due to the chance of a false negative when there is a ranger nearby. Because of the chance of a false negative, it will also sound the alarm when it sees nothing. The main idea is so that rangers know if the poachers have been spotted, but the poachers do not. This helps deter poachers keeping endangered species safer than they were without this technology.
