        <h4>Cloud Computing</h4>
        <p>This website was put together utlising GitHub, a cloud based application that uses Git</p>
        <p>Cloud based services allow you to store and access files remotely and without neesing to download them to a local storage, assuming you have access to the internet.</p>
        <p>Many things in day to day life utilise "The Cloud", such as: <ul>
                                                                          <li>Social Media</li>
                                                                          <li>Video Streaming</li>
                                                                          <li>Email</li>
                                                                          <li>Cloud Storage</li>
                                                                        </ul></p>

        <h4>Keeping us connected during the pandemic:</h4>
        <p>Allowed transition of work from in person to remote during the pandemic. Allowed children to be schooled and educated at the same time. Remote work has become part of the new normal and has become a much more common and prominent requriement for jobs seekers.</p>
        <p>Kept families and friends together when they couldnt see each other</p>
        <p>Cloud computing allows work to be stored and accessed remotely, away from the office. Also allows people to meet virtually, bringing the office to your home</p>
        <p>Meet up with your friends without leaving the house and store photos, videos and messages without needing them physcially written to your hardware</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row mx-5">
      <h4>Software</h4>
      <p>Cloud based services allow for software applications to be downloaded and updated remotely from an internet browser, instead of needing to be manually installed from a drive or disc</p>
      <p>Much more convenient as allows everyone, anywhere access to the applications. Especially useful for applications that may recieve frequent updates, ie. Video Games or Anti-Virus Software</p>
